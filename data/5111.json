    "text": " The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 began a revolution in the diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of human disease. More than a decade later, the promise of personalized genome-guided medical treatment and precision medicine is becoming a reality, and is a focus of major national and international initiatives. This course will explore how genomic information has enhanced our understanding of human genetic variation, disease susceptibility, and treatment options. Students will develop familiarity with primary literature relevant to genomic medicine, and learn how to use modern computational tools to interpret genomic data in case studies and problem sets based on disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.  Students will complete an independent project focused on a particular disease, integrating literature review with new analyses of published data. This course takes the approach of discovery-based learning."

The quality and lucidity of writing, visual data presentation, and critical self-evaluation (i.e., what are the shortcomings and limitations of methods/data used) will each be assigned a significant weight."

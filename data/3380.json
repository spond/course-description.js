    "Description": {
        "text": " The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 began a revolution in the diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of human disease. As a part of this revolution, many areas of biology has become data-driven and quantitative. Modern genomic biology, biomedicine, and evolutionary genomics, and vitally dependent on key bioinformatic tools and algorithms. This course is design to introduce students to key informatics and algorithmic concepts widely used in bioinformatics and computational biology, and to equip this with operational knowledge of the 'must-know' tools used by scientists and practitioners today. Students will complete an independent project using the tools and techniques learned in the course, integrating literature review, new analyses of published data using software tools and pipelines, data visualization and interpretation, and formal report writing. This course takes the approach of discovery-based learning. Each lecture will be structured to cover one discrete topic, with a brief background, introduction of key concepts, tutorials, and guided software exercises."

Topics will be selected after consultation with the instructor. A successfully completed project will have the structure of a peer-reviewed paper: historical context and novel aspects of the research, justification and critical selection of methods, data analysis and results, and discussion of the obtained results. The quality and lucidity of writing, visual data presentation, and critical self-evaluation (i.e., what are the shortcomings and limitations of methods/data used) will each be assigned a significant weight."

As a part of this revolution, many areas of biology has become data-driven and quantitative. Modern genomic biology, biomedicine, and evolutionary genomics, and vitally dependent on key bioinformatic tools and algorithms. This course is design to introduce students to key informatics and algorithmic concepts widely used in bioinformatics and computational biology, and to equip this with operational knowledge of the 'must-know' tools used by scientists and practitioners today. Students will complete an independent project using the tools and techniques learned in the course, integrating literature review, new analyses of published data using software tools and pipelines, data visualization and interpretation, and formal report writing. This course takes the approach of discovery-based learning. Each lecture will be structured to cover one discrete topic, with a brief background, introduction of key concepts, tutorials, and guided software exercises."
